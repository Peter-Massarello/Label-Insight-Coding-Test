Problem 1
----------------------------------------------------
# Missing Letters
The sentence "A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" contains every single letter in
the alphabet. Such sentences are called pangrams. You are to write a method
getMissingLetters, which takes as input a string containing a sentence and returns all
the letters not present at all in the sentence (i.e., the letters that prevent it from being a
pangram). You should ignore the case of the letters in sentence, and your return should
be all lower case letters, in alphabetical order. You should also ignore all non­alphabet
characters as well as all non­US­ASCII characters.Imagine that the method you write will be called many thousands of times in rapid
succession on strings with length ranging from 0 to 50. Accordingly, you should try to
write code that runs as quickly as possible. Also, imagine the case when the input string
is quite large (e.g., tens of megabytes). See if you can develop an algorithm that
handles this case efficiently while still running very quickly on smaller inputs.

Problem 2
----------------------------------------------------
# Animation
A collection of particles is contained in a linear chamber. They all have the same speed,
but some are headed toward the right and others are headed toward the left. These
particles can pass through each other without disturbing the motion of the particles, so
all the particles will leave the chamber relatively quickly.
You will be given the initial conditions by a string 'init' containing at each position an 'L'
for a leftward moving particle, an 'R' for a rightward moving particle, or a '.' for an empty
location. 'init' shows all the positions in the chamber. Initially, no location in the chamber
contains two particles passing through each other.
We would like an animation of the particles as they move. At each unit of time, we want
a string showing occupied locations with an 'X' and unoccupied locations with a '.'.
Create a method 'animate' that takes a positive integer 'speed' and a string 'init' giving
the initial conditions. The speed is the number of positions each particle moves in one
unit of time. The method will return an array of strings in which each successive element
shows the occupied locations at each time step. The first element of the return should show
the occupied locations at the initial instant (at time = 0) in the 'X', '.' format. The
last element in the return should show the empty chamber at the first time that it
becomes empty.
Again, imagine that the method you write will be called thousands of times for varying
initial conditions with size ranging from 0 to 50, and also imagine the case when init is
several hundred thousand locations in size (though with speed > size / 20 or so).  Try to
handle both of these cases efficiently in your implementation.

----------------------------------------------------
One assumption I made was that I had my 'animate()' method return an arraylist of strings instead
of an array of strings. I did this because of the way I already had my program structured. It was
simpler for me to use an array list where I can easily keep adding elements to it during runtime
instead of dealing with a normal array. I emailed asking if this was an okay assumption to make but
I didn't receive a response back and as I have finals coming up, I didn't want to wait and forget to
submit on time. I hope this wasn't out of bounds to think.

Thank you.
